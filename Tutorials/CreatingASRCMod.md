# Creating a source code mod
Creating a source code mod is not that hard, but the thing is in learning how to program.
This documentation is intended to be used by programmers who already knows how to program using Lua & LÃ–VE Framework.

## Creating the basic mod files
Creating a mod will allways require the creation of the basic files, To do that, follow the [offical tutorial](http://www.moveordiegame.com/modding/intro) from the TAG team till the "How To Make A Mod" part.

## SRC Mod structure:
* /Mods/YourMod/Lib/ **Here goes all the assets you wanna add to the game**
* /Mods/YourMod/Src/Modes/ **Here is where all the gamemodes code go in**
* /Mods/YourMod/Src/Mutators/ **Here is where all the mutators code go in**
* /Mods/YourMod/Src/Entities/ **Here is where all the entities code go in (ColorTile, CandyDispenser, FinishLine, etc..)**
